# Welcome from The Ecom Doc!

The Ecom Doc is here to resuscitate your Shopify store! Shopify’s growth in recent years has exploded, as fans of the platform, we noticed a lack of professional development services available for Shopify stores.

What exactly does “development services” mean? For starters our team at The Ecom Doc strictly specializes in custom development, optimizations and theme maintenance. This means we don’t spread our services far and wide, offering every digital marketing service under the sun, we know what we do well and we stick to that. Here are some of those services: 

-   Theme Design & Development
-   Page Speed Optimizations
-   Theme Installation & Configuration
-   Migrations to Shopify
-   Ecommerce Consulting

Our goal is to offer these services at an affordable price with efficiency and speed. We’ll take care of all of your store’s development needs so you can focus on running your business. Shoot us a message today and receive a free quote on your next Shopify project.
